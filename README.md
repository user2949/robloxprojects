# My Roblox Projects

Hello fellow friends, I am a Roblox Developer since March of 2023, so i am known as Pro_71028, i normally hack games just for fun, just when i am bored tho, so here are my projects, i am here to show you some of my projects that i have made since then till now

If you are not familiar with Coding, coding is essentialy telling the computer what to do, or you can say a client, but if you made an illegal script that runs on the server-side and the client-side, both of them will run at the same time, telling the server what to do, causing chaos, and allowing the person doing the script, free admin on the current server, allowing them pretty much anything they want


I normally do DOORS hacking, but on a 1 player side, so im not hacking on a server with people inside it. Thats all from me.
